# UX Nuggets
Some inspirational elements found around the web.

ℹ️ There's almost nothing here, I know, but I had to start some place ;) Feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/SteffenGivard/ux-nuggets/issues/new), though.

# Personal greeting

- Make your user feel welcome.
- Make it personal, instead of generic.

## Examples

### iCloud

When you log in to iCloud, you're welcomed by a friendly greeting. 
The greeting is changing according to time of day.

# Date pickers

## Examples

### YouTube

When picking a recording date for your uploaded video on YouTube, the data picker is an infinite scrolling calendar. You don't have to click trough months or years, just scroll to the desired date and click.

# Caller queue call-back

_Not sure how how title this. Also, this isn't an UX nugget from the web, rather I discovered it whioe on hold in a queue calling my insurance._

When someone calls you, and they have to wait in an queue, give 'em the option to be called back once it's their turn. Let them know, that they'll keep their position in the queue.
